                    <p>
                        These are the various posters I have created for different events, typefaces, products, etc. Poster design is a favorite hobby of mine, as I enjoy taking the essence of an event or product and putting it into one complete design.

                    <h4>MODESTO</h4>

                    <p>This poster was created to show off the unique capabilities of the Modesto typeface. For this poster, I chose to reflect the history of the type, which was inspired by the typefaces seen on circus posters, as well as the Modesto train station. For this piece, I designed a variety of tickets; each inspired by vintage railroad, movie, and circus tickets. </p>

                    <p>The back of the poster showcases the type itself, in the variety of different weights and styles that it comes in. This poster was made using Adobe Illustrator and InDesign.</p>

                    <h4>ENDFAIR</h4>

                    <p>These EndFair posters are a concept project I worked on for a yearly event hosted in the dorms at Western Washington University. This student-led music festival promotes local artists, giving students a fun experience to take a break from their long weeks of classes.</p>

                    <p>For this project, I wanted to capture the fun summer energy of the festival and the bands that perform at it. Bellingham has such a beautiful and energetic music scene tat I wanted to portray through this collection of posters. Using Illustrator, I combined both shape and type into one bold design.</p>

                    <h4>PLANT POSITIVITY</h4>

                    <p>This is a poster set I created for an event that was hosted in the dorms at Western. I was inspired by the beautiful flowers that were growing all over campus at the time. What started as a simple doodle on procreate became one of my favorite poster designs I have ever made!</p>
