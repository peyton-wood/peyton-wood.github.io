                    <p>
                        Scheels is a popular sporting goods store located throughout the United States. Scheels stores are quite large, and can sometimes be difficult to navigate. In this redesign, my team and I worked to create an app that helped users navigate the store through beacon technology.

                    <h4>BRIEF</h4>

                    <p>For this project, our team was assigned the mobile application for Scheels, a large sporting goods store chain.The task is to integrate beacon technology to improve the in-store experience for customers, as well as designing an in-store navigation feature that can guide users through the store.By conducting user research and determining pain points, we will implement these and any other additional features that will enhance the shopping experience for the Scheels customer.</p>


                    <h4>THE PROBLEM & SOLUTION</h4>

                    <p>Scheels currently has a large retail footprint, and customers find it difficult to navigate the store and find products they are looking for. By incorporating beacon technology, Scheels can provide a customers with a more seamless shopping experience.</p>
                        
                    <p>By designing an in-store navigation system, this will help customers navigate the store and discover products they need, therefore increasing both customer satisfaction and sales.</p>

                <div class="text-right-half">
                    <h4>MAP & BEACON TECH</h4>

                    <p>To expand the capabilities of the beacon technology within the app, we created a map feature to allow the user to track where they are in the store, and navigate to the items they would like to by.</p>

                    <p>The app allows the user to toggle between floors and look at some of the different attractions available. </p>

                    <p>When the user looks up a product, they have the option to to follow a guided path to the area in which the object is sold. This allows for smoother and easier navigation within the store.</p>

                    <h4>PRODUCT SCANNER</h4>

                    <p>The product scanner would allow users to quickly navigate to any product they're looking for. This new scanner would also allow users to see options that may be available online but not in the store, such as different colors, sizes, or materials.</p>

                    <p>This scanner makes finding what users are looking for quick and easy, allowing for a fast and stress-free shopping experience.</p>

                <div class="text-right-half">
                    <h4>PRODUCT PAGE</h4>

                    <p>Redesigning the product page consists of organizing the most important aspects of the product such as: description, price, sizes, and quantity.</p>

                    <p>Keeping beacon technology in mind, it was also important to add the location of the product with a navigation icon that will take you to the product's location.</p>

                    <p>Designing the product page with the user experience of the customer in mind allowed for us to place things strategically to influence the customer to purchase the product.</p>


                    <h4>PROMOTIONS</h4>

                    <p>Paired with the beacon technology, we also designed push notifications that would bring promotions directly to the user as they walked around the store. These promotions and sales could be used when the shopper is ready to check out. By brining these promotions directly to the customer, it could increase sales.
                    </p>


                    <h4>WALLET</h4>

                    <p>The in-app wallet includes digital Scheels gift cards and Scheels Visa, along with their personal credit card, all sorted by sections for user convenience. The interactive feature allows users to select their desired payment method and can be used to pay in-store.</p>
