                    <p>This poster was created to show off the unique capabilities of the Modesto typeface. For this poster, I chose to reflect the history of the type, which was inspired by the typefaces seen on circus posters, as well as signs at the Modesto train station. For this piece, I designed a variety of tickets; each inspired by vintage railroad, movie, and circus tickets.</p>

                    <p>The back of the poster showcases the type itself, in the variety of different weights and styles that it comes in. This poster was made using Adobe Illustrator and InDesign.</p>
