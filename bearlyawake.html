                    <h1>Bearly Awake</h1>
                    <p>I was hired to create the branding for a local coffee shop, Bearly Awake Coffee Co. This branding project included logos, a menu, and a variety of merchandise and advertisements. The posters were created to decorate the side of the coffee stand, creating a fun environment and capturing the customers' attention.</p>

                    <p>The owners of the coffee shop wanted to create a brand that was welcoming and set them apart from other coffee shops in the area. When looking at other nearby stands, many had a very natural and organic feel, reflecting the nature found within the pacific northwest. After consulting with the owners, we decided to create a more modern and exciting branding scheme to stand out from the competition.</p>

                    <p>The shades of green and blue in the branding reflect the beautiful nature found on Whidbey Island, where the shop is located. The pink, however, creates a bright and fun pop of color to capture the audience's attention.</p>
