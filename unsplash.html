                    <h1>Unsplash.</h1>

                    <p>
                        Unsplash is a stock image site and app focused on providing free, high-quality images to anyone who wants them. It allows users to share their photos, enabling people around the world to access and utilize them in their projects. In this redesign, my team and I worked to make the Unsplash app more social, as well as easier for users to navigate while sharing on-the-go.

                    <h4>BRIEF</h4>

                    <p>We were assigned to research, redesign, prototype, and reboot the Unsplash app. Our goal is to pinpoint the problems and make improvements.</p>

                    <h4>THE PROBLEM</h4>

                    <p>Some of the issues we found within the Unsplash app include a lack of privacy settings, overwhelming navigation options, a lack of personality for users/photos, and a lack of differentiation from other similar stock photo services. The main problem boils down to an inefficient workflow that makes the app not very nice to use.</p>

                    <h4>COMPETITOR RESEARCH</h4>

                    <p>We started by taking a look at Unsplash's leading competitors, including Adobe Stock, Shutterstock, Pexels, Flickr, and Freepik. One feature we noticed available in other stock photo apps on the market was a very social aspect. The Unsplash app was solely used for uploading stock photos, which often meant users weren't using the app all that much unless they were traveling. In order to retain users on the app, we wanted to add a more social aspect so users could interact and follow each other, creating a connected community.</p>

                    <h4>USER RESEARCH</h4>

                    <p>Through user surveys, we were able to gather key info on Unsplash's audience, which would help further our knowledge on possible improvements we could make on the app. Some key feedback we received from those we interviewed was that the app was a bit difficult to navigate, and some users struggled differentiating between free stock photos and those available through Unsplash+. Many users voiced that they didn't usually use apps to look for stock photos, and many don't use the app very often.</p>

                    <h4>HIGH-FIDELITY WIREFRAMES</h4>

                    <p>We found that the profile page was the most crucial for us to update in order to create community within the app. We created a more robust profile format that information about the user. By including a bio, those viewing the images could better connect with the person they were sourcing their stock photos from.</p>

                    <p>We also wanted to update the home page to include a more convenient way to search and filter images. In order to do this we added a separate tab for filtering, rather than the filters they had placed at the top. By limiting these features, users would have less confusion on what options they had to choose from.</p>

                    <p>As a team we divided the app up and each worked on individual sections. To keep the design cohesive we agreed on a general look for the app and brand, including our button styles and color palette. From there we worked to implement the goals we outlined in our wireframes, as well as any feedback we received from the users we had surveyed.</p>
